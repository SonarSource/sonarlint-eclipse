# SonarQube for Eclipse: Integration tests

This project including its modules contains the integration tests (including compatibility against
[iBuilds](https://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/), the in-development version of the Eclipse IDE) for
SonarQube that are relying on [Eclipse RedDeer](https://github.com/SonarSource/reddeer) (in our case, our fork) as the
test framework connected to [Eclipse Tycho](https://github.com/eclipse-tycho/tycho).

The tests are split into separate modules for testing in Standalone Mode only, with the integration into CDT (which is
also in Standalone Mode), in Connected Mode with SonarQube Server and SonarQube Cloud. Additionally, one module is used
for shared logic. This Maven/Tycho project is completely decoupled from the main SonarQube for Eclipse project.

## Building

In order to build the integration tests, the main SonarQube for Eclipse project must be build first to create the
Eclipse Update Site. On the CI/CD pipeline this is not done in one step, but locally it has to be done.

The target platform provided must be one of the supported in the `target-platforms` folder inside the main SonarQube
for Eclipse project directory.

```
cd $SONARLINT_FOR_ECLIPSE_FOLDER
mvn clean verify -DskipTests
cd its/
mvn clean verify -Dtarget.platform=latest-java-17_e431 -Dtycho.localArtifacts=ignore -Dsonarlint-eclipse.p2.url="file://{path to repo}/org.sonarlint.eclipse.site/target/repository" -DskipTests
```

When all the projects are opened inside Eclipse and the target platform correctly configured, this is done in the
background (not for the main SonarQube for Eclipse project tho if not also imported into Eclipse, which is required).

## Running the Tests

When imported inside Eclipse, the tests can be run simply via the RedDeer context menu options, but only tests of one
module should be run at most, or only one test class or one specific test. This is due to the different modules using
different "runtime definitions" (the `.product` files) for the Tycho/Surefire test runtime for starting an Eclipse IDE
instance.

### Standalone Mode / iBuilds compatibility

To run all the tests, or a specific one with the additionally command line option `-Dtest={TestClassName}`, for the
Standalone Mode, the following command has to be run that excludes the tests for the Connected Mode with SonarQube
Server and SonarQube Cloud and the integration into CDT.

The target platform provided must be one of the supported in the `target-platforms` folder inside the main SonarQube
for Eclipse project directory. For Standalone Mode all target platforms are useful, for the iBuilds compatibility the
`ibuilds` target platform must be used.

```
mvn clean verify -Dtarget.platform=latest-java-17_e431 -Dtycho.localArtifacts=ignore -Dsonarlint-eclipse.p2.url="file://{path to repo}/org.sonarlint.eclipse.site/target/repository" -P \!connectedModeSc,\!connectedModeSq,\!cdtIntegration
```

### Connected Mode (SonarQube Server)

To run all the tests, or a specific one with the additionally command line option `-Dtest={TestClassName}`, for the
Connected Mode with SonarQube Server, the following command has to be run that excludes the tests for the Standalone
Mode and the Connected Mode with SonarQube Cloud and the integration into CDT. With the additional command line option
`-Dsonar.runtimeVersion={version alias}` (see
[Orchestrator documentation](https://github.com/SonarSource/orchestrator?tab=readme-ov-file#version-aliases)) the
specific SonarQube Server version can be configured, the default one is `LATEST_RELEASE`.

The target platform provided should be run against the latest one linked to the Eclipse IDE that is shipped with Java
17 (Eclipse IDE 2024-03 / 4.31). This is also what the CI/CD pipeline is doing in order to provide the correct runtime
for the SonarQube Server instance provided via [Orchestrator](https://github.com/SonarSource/orchestrator) for the
latest supported LTA version, the latest supported version and the currently in-development version (of SonarQube
Server).

```
mvn clean verify -Dtarget.platform=latest-java-17_e431 -Dtycho.localArtifacts=ignore -Dsonarlint-eclipse.p2.url="file://{path to repo}/org.sonarlint.eclipse.site/target/repository" -P \!standaloneMode,\!connectedModeSc,\!cdtIntegration
```

### Connected Mode (SonarQube Cloud)

To run all the tests, or a specific one with the additionally command line option `-Dtest={TestClassName}`, for the
Connected Mode with SonarQube Cloud, the following command has to be run that excludes the tests for the Standalone
Mode and the Connected Mode with SonarQube Server and the integration into CDT.

The target platform provided must be one of the supported in the `target-platforms` folder inside the main SonarQube
for Eclipse project directory. Compared to the integration tests for the Connected Mode with SonarQube Cloud there is
no dependency on the Java version and the CI/CD pipeline will run against the latest one linked to the Eclipse IDE that
is shipped with Java 21 (the current Java runtime used for upcoming releases as well).

Due to us requiring the token for the SonarQube Cloud staging environment, we have to pass it directly to the command
as the Eclipse IDE runtime won't pick it up otherwise via `System.getenv("SONARCLOUD_IT_TOKEN")`!

```
env SONARCLOUD_IT_TOKEN=$SONARCLOUD_IT_TOKEN mvn clean verify -Dtarget.platform=latest-java-21 -Dtycho.localArtifacts=ignore -Dsonarlint-eclipse.p2.url="file://{path to repo}/org.sonarlint.eclipse.site/target/repository" -P \!standaloneMode,\!connectedModeSq,\!cdtIntegration
```

### CDT integration

To run all the tests, or a specific one with the additionally command line option `-Dtest={TestClassName}`, for the
integration into CDT, the following command has to be run that excludes the tests for the Standalone
Mode and the Connected Mode with SonarQube Server and the Connected Mode with SonarQube Cloud.

The target platform provided must be one of the supported in the `target-platforms` folder inside the main SonarQube
for Eclipse project directory. For the integration into CDT, all target platforms are useful, for the iBuilds
compatibility the `ibuilds` target platform must be used.

```
mvn clean verify -Dtarget.platform=latest-java-17_e431 -Dtycho.localArtifacts=ignore -Dsonarlint-eclipse.p2.url="file://{path to repo}/org.sonarlint.eclipse.site/target/repository" -P \!standaloneMode,\!connectedModeSc,\!connectedModeSq
```
